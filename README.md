# Example

```rust

extern crate futures;
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_json;

use eventstore::{ Connection, EventData };
use futures::Future;

fn main() {
    let connection = Connection::builder()
        .start("127.0.0.1:1113")
        .unwrap();

    // It is not mandatory to use JSON as a data format however GetEventStore
    // provides great additional values if you do so.
    let payload = json!({
        "is_rust_a_nice_language": true,
    });

    let event = EventData::json("language-poll", payload);

    // All the operations are asynchronous but for the sake of this example
    // we decide to wait until the server sends a response.
    let result = connection
        .write_events("language-stream")
        .push_event(event)
        .execute()
        .wait()
        .unwrap();

    // Do something productive with the result.
}
```
